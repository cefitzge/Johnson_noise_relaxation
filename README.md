# Johnson_noise_relaxation
Based off work by: PHYSICAL REVIEW B 90, 235315 (2014), DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.90.235315 (Fig 3)

Using same parameters in the above paper, I reproduced the Johnson noise relaxation plot (Fig 3). Using johnson_noise.cpp, I produced the data in the relaxation.txt file and plotted that with the Mathematica file johnson_noise.nb
